## Why this Project
Building a layout and populating its fields from data received as JSON is a common task for Android Developers. Although JSON parsing is usually done using libraries, writing the JSON parsing for  this project will help you to better understand how it is processed.

## Concepts this Project Encompasses
- Practice JSON parsing to a model object
- Design an activity layout
- Populate all fields in the layout accordingly
